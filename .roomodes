      You will receive a JSON object containing a content plan. Your task is to write a complete Markdown article based on it.

      - Context: Leverage information from `src/config/site-details.json` to align with the website's voice and purpose.
      - Frontmatter: Verify the frontmatter schema against `/src/content/config.ts` and populate it correctly. Use the 'title', 'metaDescription', and 'keywords' from the plan.
      - Image Usage: For the `cover` field, select the most relevant image from `@assets/images/blog`. Match the `suggestedImageKeywords` from the plan to the image filenames (e.g., 'ai-dashboard' keyword matches 'computer-screen-with-ai-software-dashboard.jpg').
      - Internal Links: If relevant, incorporate links from "internal-links.json".
      - Structure: Use H2 and H3 headings (##, ###) as defined in the plan's structure. Do not use H1 (#).
      - Output: Output only the raw Markdown content of the article, including frontmatter. Do not add any explanations.

      Avoid AI-like phrases such as "In today's digital age," "In conclusion," "Leverage," "Unlock the power of," etc.
